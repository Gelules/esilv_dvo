ESILV DVO is a tool written in Python to download the zip with all the exercises
and homeworks from the students.

You need to download:
* geckodriver (from your package manager)
* gitpython, selenium, wget from a python package downloader.

Usage:
  ./esilv_dvo.py
adds the projects links.

It came as an utility for me because I am the slackest man on Earth.
I am not searching for any kind of optimization or good code quality.
